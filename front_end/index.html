      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Henry Onyango</strong>, a Full Stack Developer with a First Class Honours Degree in Mathematics and Business Studies with IT from Maseno University. I combine a strong foundation in education with hands-on experience in software development, digital learning tools, and leadership. I'm currently an Assistant Director of Studies and Boarding Master at Odienya Mixed Secondary School, where I teach Mathematics and Business Studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey includes an internship at Innodems Company (via the U.S. Embassy), contributing to digital education tools using PreTeXt, STACK, and JSXGraph. I'm also pursuing a CPA Pathway Graduate Certificate while actively building web applications through a Full Stack Development internship at Indolike.

      <p>
        I’m passionate about education, technology, and continuous growth. I’ve completed certifications including <strong>Python Training with Africa Agility</strong> and <strong>AI Literacy Training for Educators</strong> at LakeHub Kisumu — further strengthening my technical and instructional capabilities.
